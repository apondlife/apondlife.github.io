            an beautiful imagination game for any number of people (even one). you all close your eyes, lie down if you’re so inclined, and imagine you’re in a darkroom developing a photo. it’s sitting in a tray of developer, currently blank. the goal is not to invent anything, but to describe whatever you actually see in your imagination. when you notice something, say it out loud. at a certain point you’ll all know the photo is done, and you can take it out of the tray and develop the next one.

            one person holds a projector towards the ground, pretty high up so to people can fit in the box of light it creates. it's nice if you put something fun on the screen. slowly lower the projector towards the ground while the two people in the box try and squeeze each other out of the space as it gets smaller.

            this is one to play before you all head home. everyone puts their hands in the middle and pick a word to say together on the count of 5. like, "turtle on 5!". then try to count to 5, but each person is only allowed to say one number in a row, and if two people say a number at the same time, you start over. when you get to 5, shout your word, throw your hands in the air, and head home. you could play to a different number if you're feeling up for it.
