true, at least\n    adjacent to things i&#39;ve felt (though perhaps been unable to conciously\n    identify).\n  </p>\n\n  <p>personally, i like getting dunked on. though i don&#39;t wish it dunkings on\n    anyone who isn&#39;t interested in receiving them. i can recall a number of\n    pretty formative dunkings in my life that have shaped who i am today, or\n    at least shaped how i think about certain subjects.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>there was the time a youtube commenter pointed out that a lot of people\n    think ray kurzweil is a hack. i think the saved me from going down a\n    pretty gross path. there was that time in undergrad that one my classmates\n    looked horrified and never spoke to me again after i misinterpreted their\n    attempt to connect as an opportunity to share how i felt completely\n    differently from them about the reading we had done for class that\n    morning. i think about that one a lot (ugh).\n  </p>\n\n  <p>there was the time a few months ago when of similar anarchist disposition\n    illustrated in great detail w/ many references the reactionary nature of\n    my views on blockchain / crypto in the mentions of an organization i have\n    a lot of respect for (crypto on average still Very Bad, full of hucksters,\n    its well poisoned, but maybe worth exploring its transformative potential\n    w/ open mind). this one also helped me see for real my personal\n    vulnerability to the mind-warping badness of twitter &amp; similar online\n    communities.\n  </p></section>"},{"name":"chew, theme(s)","date":"2021-12-15T05:52:00.000Z","meta":{"author":"ty"},"body":"<section class=\"PostBody\"><p>wanna keep these posts short and respondable, so i&#39;m going to try and\n    break them up thematically. this one is about what i would personally like\n    to do, at least as far as i can see right now thisveryminute.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>i want to make something chewier than what we have on this first\n    prototype. something that&#39;s like 30% stuff the weight of what we have in\n    <a class=\"Link svelte-193kav2\" href=\"/zines/rats\">rats\n  </a>, 40% stuff thats a bit chewier, and\n    30% something quite chewy. where that cheweist 30% is something we could\n    reuse issue-to-issue.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>re. theme, it doesn&#39;t seem to me like picking a single theme is a good\n    solution. i am happy to create within the constraints of a theme, but it\n    might be better to work in a container that is permissive of more themes.\n    so that people who are excited about a theme can explore it until they&#39;re\n    tired of it. so that we can each fall off at different rates and move on\n    to what we care about, but still contribute to some greater whole.\n    something unified not by theme, but by its aesthetic container:\n    audio/visual/literary/ludic(yuck/sorry/such/a/gross/word)/&amp;c gum that\n    binds everything together. i don&#39;t think that means the container needs to\n    be homogenous. it just means that there needs to be some aesthetic thread\n    linking two of its constituent parts together, even if the thread between\n    another two is totally different.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>the container that&#39;s exciting me most atm is something like mystical ninja\n    starring goemon. a weird and irrevent three dimensional world to walk\n    around in. where characters say things to you: maybe tell a joke, announce\n    the full text essay, present you with a tiny playable. where you can walk\n    around and struggle to not trip over divergent little experiments,\n    minigames, games, &amp;c. maybe less of a zine or issue and more of a\n    demodisc. or less of a demodisc and more a playable prototype(s) that the\n    developers sent to a prospective publisher to try and entice them into\n    business. a bunch of stuff people poured their hearts into but wisely left\n    behind before their hearts went out of it.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>and i&#39;d like to figure out how to make money. to sustain. to get real. a\n    bit ago i tweeted that i don&#39;t individual passion is durable. that\n    anything sustainable needs to be the socialize passion, interest. a thing\n    will fail, fall apart, be unsustainable otherwise. i still believe it.\n  </p></section>"},{"name":"an outlet","date":"2021-12-15T05:30:00.000Z","meta":{"author":"ty"},"body":"<section class=\"PostBody\"><p>had a mess of thoughts &amp; feelings swirling around in my head this evening,\n    the sort of stuff i&#39;d usually exorcise in a retro. everyone else is busy\n    or unavailable tho, so i beat metroid dread (ugh) &amp; got an ice cream &amp; got\n    six-pack of beer &amp; decided to write (that these kind of thoughts often get\n    left effectively undocumented on the retro board makes me feel like we\n    should find a way to easily serialize those conversations into a format\n    that can be left on the web instead. that others (or we) can revisit in\n    the future. maybe a lightly edited / auto-transcribed audio recording?).\n  </p>\n\n  <p>we received some critical feedback about the our zine today that left me\n    feeling pretty deflated. w/o much motivation to continue working on the\n    zine or any of the games in it. the feedback was principally about layout\n    decisions we&#39;d made in response to <em>other</em> feedback we&#39;ve received.\n    i think i usually do a pretty good job of leaving feedback on the floor\n    that i don&#39;t feel like serves my own creative goals, but i think i kinda\n    failed this time.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>as a result, i&#39;d spent a lot of effort this past weekend to try and pull\n    some of the threads together on the presentation-side of the zine, and it\n    felt like work. and it <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> feel like work. it should feel\n    fun. that should&#39;ve been the first sniff that something was off (three\n    &quot;should&quot;s in a row, no good). one nice thing about this particular piece\n    of feedback is that it&#39;s made me realize i was doing this work for purely\n    external validation. it wasn&#39;t for me, and that&#39;s not sustainable. what&#39;s\n    the point of that? (a lot of &quot;me&quot;s too, but i don&#39;t want to speak for\n    anyone else).\n  </p></section>"}]
