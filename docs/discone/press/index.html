    <h3>short desctiption</h3>
    <p>run &amp; jump around</p>
    <p>a giant imponderable world</p>
    <p>with affecting characters</p>
    <p>at first alone</p>
    <p>in pondlife:</p>
    <p>discóne</p>
    <p>(a videogame)</p>
    

    <h3>long description</h3>
    <p>discone is an open-world move-em-up: it centers the expressiveness and feeling of moving a character in 3d space. it seeks
      to design an experience where that is enough: where movement is meaningful enough that it&#39;s a sufficient invitation for
      players to play. it&#39;s an inscrutable world full of characters to talk to, who both say cute things to you and who you then
      embody – jumping into their body directly. every character walks, runs, jumps, and feels dinsticlty, and each provides a
      player the opportunity to explore and discover the nuances of that character&#39;s individual expression, their individual
      being. there are no player or non-player characters in discone. there are simply characters.
    </p>

    <p>similarly, discone&#39;s open, partially-generated world provides a canvas for players to explore the interactions of different
      characters with different surfaces, with their capacity to touch. it&#39;s a playground or toybox. it describes no explicit
      objectives or quests, but instead surfaces a litany of obstacles. why and how and what obstacles players choose to tackle is
      up to them, their goals are theirs to discover, not ours to prescribe.
    </p>

    <p>and they don&#39;t need to do it alone. discone is an online, mingleplayer videogame. players can see one another, express
      themselves and communicate using their bodies &amp; learned movements, and explore the world together. there are no collisions,
      no physics – what is networked is kept deliberately simple – but it provides a space for friends and strangers to exist,
      play, and hang out.
    </p>

    <p>we owe a debt to those who came before us. bernie dekoven, for the push to play well and to build community – we strive to
      play as well as he did. also &quot;[fr0g] clan official server 24/7 zk map (for stranger)&quot;, &quot;red desert render&quot;, bennett foddy,
      &quot;juice galaxy&quot;, olia lialina, &quot;final fantasy xi&quot;, &amp;c.
    </p>

    <h3>Artists Statement</h3>
    <div><p>there are no goals in this videogame, but we have some goals.</p>

      <p>discone is an exploration of videogames beyond gameness: beyond designed rules and designer-defined objectives. we, as
        designers, create the physics, the space, and the characters. players create the play.
      </p>

      <p>our goal is to create an exciting world that allows players to move around in their expressive character-bodies. to
        explore and pull at the videogame&#39;s seams, left there intentionally or unintentionally. we believe that a novel,
        intuitively explorable, &amp; experientially understood movement system situated in an online space has infinite potential,
        and we are excited to explore this possibility space.
      </p>

      <p>discone affords the open exploration and discovery—the ability to pick a point on the horizon—of &quot;elden ring&quot; but without
        any combat or external conflict. it affords the casual socialization and community of games like &quot;runescape&quot; or &quot;club
        penguin&quot; but provides it in the context of a challenge-oriented, self-directed 3d platformer. like &quot;getting over it&quot;, it
        affords the exciting stress of embodying and manipulating an alien avatar along a path but provides it via an infinity of
        player-selected paths. are those mountains even climbable? (they definitely are)
      </p>

      <p>we&#39;re crafting a visual style that evinces a no-frills approach to artmaking. it embraces simplicity and childlike wonder,
        leans into the constraints of exploring limited tools like mspaint &amp; kidpix (or the pixel), and explores the territory
        outside the boundaries of traditional art &amp; its received aesthetic norms. we are inspired by paint and exploring
        pixel-based art (all screen art is pixel art) as an impressionism, as something beyond chunky, low-resolution pixels. our
        approach to 3d-rendering accepts &amp; embraces the glitchiness, the inherent flatness of polygons &amp; deformed meshes, its
        seams &amp; pointed edges.
      </p>

      <p>discone is a game with no bosses and no ladders.</p></div></div></div>
