          <p class="Event-body">
            we played some games in prospect park, our first real playtest. we attempted to project
            <a href="http://frogf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frogf.org</a>, but
            ran into server issues and had to abandon it. we ended up streaming the super mario bros.
            movie, vibing, and playing some folk games (in the grass!). even at this first
            event, <a href="/games#zending">new</a> <a href="/games#lightbox">new</a> games were
            invented! it felt vital.

          <p class="Event-metadata">
            willoughby street, 10.06.21
          </p>

          <p class="Event-body">
            <p>
            we were invited to have a spot in the event willoughby walks, organized by
            <a href="https://www.downtownbrooklyn.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downtown brooklyn</a>.
            we were able to get a battery from itp, and had a tv screen running
            <a href="http://frogf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frogf.org</a>, which was now fixed.
            some of our computers had problems with connecting to the website, but we eventually sorted it out. we then had
            the problem of how to get people to interact with us. since there were only four of us present at this time, and
            one of us tasked with documenting, it was hard to start something that seemed active enough to draw peoples
            attention. we invented the <a href="/games#forkgame">forkgame</a>, which we got to play with at least two
            strangers, and felt great. we also had some games from the new games movement to play, which we did once
            more of our friends arrived. some people seemed interested, spectating, but none actively joined us, and it
            was weird to go ask them, especially once we were a big group. in the end, we had a giant jenga tower, and a
            passerby joined very enthusiastically, and a couple others spectated, which much enthusiasm as well. there's
            probably a great video of it somewhere. our energy lasted for around 2 hours, and then we just left. it was
            very fun, but also very exausting.
