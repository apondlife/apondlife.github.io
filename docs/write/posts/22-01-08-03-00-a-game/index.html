<section class="PostBody"><p>and that maybe this sentiment is shared. but also that we want to make it so that everyone has equal say and opportunity to
    add to it, this calling the game a container
  </p>

  <p>it feels like we experimented, had nice ideas, and did not land on anything that particularly excites us (me?). the exciting
    thing right now is working together, and its pretty exciting, i love working together with pond life folks.
  </p>

  <p>now it feels to me that we should just commit to an idea, and trust that it will be awesome, maybe spend some time
    scavenging/brainstorming it until we hit something that seems exciting enough to bootstrap the process. (in my mind the RaTS
    process would&#39;ve been enough for this). I love brainstorming bullshit ideas until something sounds so good that I cant talk
    anymore.
  </p>

  <p>i will start a design document to know the desires of everyone for making a game. i am particularly interested in just making
    the dog park into a longer project. it was very fun to work with. harder thing is to avoid the online annoyance pitfalls (or
    maybe just accept them?). would be nice if it was a game to attempt to fing something that we could have done fast (a month?)
    and then just make it better.
  </p>

  <p>we need a shared notes repository</p>

  <p>lets just make a game!</p></section>
