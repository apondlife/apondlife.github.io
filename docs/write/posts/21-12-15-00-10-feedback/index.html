<section class="PostBody"><p>i think i&#39;ve got one more of these in me right now. feeling better after
    writing stuff down in slightly longer form. what was the subject of this
    one?
  </p>

  <p>oh yeah, feedback. the feedback we got today was kinda harsh. not in a
    necessariy bad way, i think everything shared was fair &amp; true, at least
    adjacent to things i&#39;ve felt (though perhaps been unable to conciously
    identify).
  </p>

  <p>personally, i like getting dunked on. though i don&#39;t wish it dunkings on
    anyone who isn&#39;t interested in receiving them. i can recall a number of
    pretty formative dunkings in my life that have shaped who i am today, or
    at least shaped how i think about certain subjects.
  </p>

  <p>there was the time a youtube commenter pointed out that a lot of people
    think ray kurzweil is a hack. i think the saved me from going down a
    pretty gross path. there was that time in undergrad that one my classmates
    looked horrified and never spoke to me again after i misinterpreted their
    attempt to connect as an opportunity to share how i felt completely
    differently from them about the reading we had done for class that
    morning. i think about that one a lot (ugh).
  </p>

  <p>there was the time a few months ago when of similar anarchist disposition
    illustrated in great detail w/ many references the reactionary nature of
    my views on blockchain / crypto in the mentions of an organization i have
    a lot of respect for (crypto on average still Very Bad, full of hucksters,
    its well poisoned, but maybe worth exploring its transformative potential
    w/ open mind). this one also helped me see for real my personal
    vulnerability to the mind-warping badness of twitter &amp; similar online
    communities.
