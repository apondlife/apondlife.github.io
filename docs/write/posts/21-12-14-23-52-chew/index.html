<section class="PostBody"><p>wanna keep these posts short and respondable, so i&#39;m going to try and
    break them up thematically. this one is about what i would personally like
    to do, at least as far as i can see right now thisveryminute.
  </p>

  <p>i want to make something chewier than what we have on this first
    prototype. something that&#39;s like 30% stuff the weight of what we have in
    <a class="Link svelte-193kav2" href="/zines/rats">rats
  </a>, 40% stuff thats a bit chewier, and
    30% something quite chewy. where that cheweist 30% is something we could
    reuse issue-to-issue.
  </p>

  <p>re. theme, it doesn&#39;t seem to me like picking a single theme is a good
    solution. i am happy to create within the constraints of a theme, but it
    might be better to work in a container that is permissive of more themes.
    so that people who are excited about a theme can explore it until they&#39;re
    tired of it. so that we can each fall off at different rates and move on
    to what we care about, but still contribute to some greater whole.
    something unified not by theme, but by its aesthetic container:
    audio/visual/literary/ludic(yuck/sorry/such/a/gross/word)/&amp;c gum that
    binds everything together. i don&#39;t think that means the container needs to
    be homogenous. it just means that there needs to be some aesthetic thread
    linking two of its constituent parts together, even if the thread between
    another two is totally different.
  </p>

  <p>the container that&#39;s exciting me most atm is something like mystical ninja
    starring goemon. a weird and irrevent three dimensional world to walk
    around in. where characters say things to you: maybe tell a joke, announce
    the full text essay, present you with a tiny playable. where you can walk
    around and struggle to not trip over divergent little experiments,
    minigames, games, &amp;c. maybe less of a zine or issue and more of a
    demodisc. or less of a demodisc and more a playable prototype(s) that the
    developers sent to a prospective publisher to try and entice them into
    business. a bunch of stuff people poured their hearts into but wisely left
    behind before their hearts went out of it.
  </p>

  <p>and i&#39;d like to figure out how to make money. to sustain. to get real. a
    bit ago i tweeted that i don&#39;t individual passion is durable. that
    anything sustainable needs to be the socialize passion, interest. a thing
    will fail, fall apart, be unsustainable otherwise. i still believe it.
