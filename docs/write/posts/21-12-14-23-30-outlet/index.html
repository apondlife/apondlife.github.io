<section class="PostBody"><p>had a mess of thoughts &amp; feelings swirling around in my head this evening,
    the sort of stuff i&#39;d usually exorcise in a retro. everyone else is busy
    or unavailable tho, so i beat metroid dread (ugh) &amp; got an ice cream &amp; got
    six-pack of beer &amp; decided to write (that these kind of thoughts often get
    left effectively undocumented on the retro board makes me feel like we
    should find a way to easily serialize those conversations into a format
    that can be left on the web instead. that others (or we) can revisit in
    the future. maybe a lightly edited / auto-transcribed audio recording?).
  </p>

  <p>we received some critical feedback about the our zine today that left me
    feeling pretty deflated. w/o much motivation to continue working on the
    zine or any of the games in it. the feedback was principally about layout
    decisions we&#39;d made in response to <em>other</em> feedback we&#39;ve received.
    i think i usually do a pretty good job of leaving feedback on the floor
    that i don&#39;t feel like serves my own creative goals, but i think i kinda
    failed this time.
  </p>

  <p>as a result, i&#39;d spent a lot of effort this past weekend to try and pull
    some of the threads together on the presentation-side of the zine, and it
    felt like work. and it <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> feel like work. it should feel
    fun. that should&#39;ve been the first sniff that something was off (three
    &quot;should&quot;s in a row, no good). one nice thing about this particular piece
    of feedback is that it&#39;s made me realize i was doing this work for purely
    external validation. it wasn&#39;t for me, and that&#39;s not sustainable. what&#39;s
    the point of that? (a lot of &quot;me&quot;s too, but i don&#39;t want to speak for
    anyone else).
