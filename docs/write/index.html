      <!-- HTML_TAG_START --><section class="PostBody"><p>i think i&#39;ve got one more of these in me right now. feeling better after
    writing stuff down in slightly longer form. what was the subject of this
    one?
  </p>

  <p>oh yeah, feedback. the feedback we got today was kinda harsh. not in a
    necessariy bad way, i think everything shared was fair &amp; true, at least
    adjacent to things i&#39;ve felt (though perhaps been unable to conciously
    identify).
  </p>

  <p>personally, i like getting dunked on. though i don&#39;t wish it dunkings on
    anyone who isn&#39;t interested in receiving them. i can recall a number of
    pretty formative dunkings in my life that have shaped who i am today, or
    at least shaped how i think about certain subjects.
  </p>

  <p>there was the time a youtube commenter pointed out that a lot of people
    think ray kurzweil is a hack. i think the saved me from going down a
    pretty gross path. there was that time in undergrad that one my classmates
    looked horrified and never spoke to me again after i misinterpreted their
    attempt to connect as an opportunity to share how i felt completely
    differently from them about the reading we had done for class that
    morning. i think about that one a lot (ugh).
  </p>

  <p>there was the time a few months ago when of similar anarchist disposition
    illustrated in great detail w/ many references the reactionary nature of
    my views on blockchain / crypto in the mentions of an organization i have
    a lot of respect for (crypto on average still Very Bad, full of hucksters,
    its well poisoned, but maybe worth exploring its transformative potential
    w/ open mind). this one also helped me see for real my personal
    vulnerability to the mind-warping badness of twitter &amp; similar online
    communities.

        <h2 class="Post-date">12/14/21, 11:52pm</h2></header>

      <!-- HTML_TAG_START --><section class="PostBody"><p>wanna keep these posts short and respondable, so i&#39;m going to try and
    break them up thematically. this one is about what i would personally like
    to do, at least as far as i can see right now thisveryminute.
  </p>

  <p>i want to make something chewier than what we have on this first
    prototype. something that&#39;s like 30% stuff the weight of what we have in
    <a class="Link svelte-193kav2" href="/zines/rats">rats
  </a>, 40% stuff thats a bit chewier, and
    30% something quite chewy. where that cheweist 30% is something we could
    reuse issue-to-issue.
  </p>

  <p>re. theme, it doesn&#39;t seem to me like picking a single theme is a good
    solution. i am happy to create within the constraints of a theme, but it
    might be better to work in a container that is permissive of more themes.
    so that people who are excited about a theme can explore it until they&#39;re
    tired of it. so that we can each fall off at different rates and move on
    to what we care about, but still contribute to some greater whole.
    something unified not by theme, but by its aesthetic container:
    audio/visual/literary/ludic(yuck/sorry/such/a/gross/word)/&amp;c gum that
    binds everything together. i don&#39;t think that means the container needs to
    be homogenous. it just means that there needs to be some aesthetic thread
    linking two of its constituent parts together, even if the thread between
    another two is totally different.
  </p>

  <p>the container that&#39;s exciting me most atm is something like mystical ninja
    starring goemon. a weird and irrevent three dimensional world to walk
    around in. where characters say things to you: maybe tell a joke, announce
    the full text essay, present you with a tiny playable. where you can walk
    around and struggle to not trip over divergent little experiments,
    minigames, games, &amp;c. maybe less of a zine or issue and more of a
    demodisc. or less of a demodisc and more a playable prototype(s) that the
    developers sent to a prospective publisher to try and entice them into
    business. a bunch of stuff people poured their hearts into but wisely left
    behind before their hearts went out of it.
  </p>

  <p>and i&#39;d like to figure out how to make money. to sustain. to get real. a
    bit ago i tweeted that i don&#39;t individual passion is durable. that
    anything sustainable needs to be the socialize passion, interest. a thing
    will fail, fall apart, be unsustainable otherwise. i still believe it.

      <!-- HTML_TAG_START --><section class="PostBody"><p>had a mess of thoughts &amp; feelings swirling around in my head this evening,
    the sort of stuff i&#39;d usually exorcise in a retro. everyone else is busy
    or unavailable tho, so i beat metroid dread (ugh) &amp; got an ice cream &amp; got
    six-pack of beer &amp; decided to write (that these kind of thoughts often get
    left effectively undocumented on the retro board makes me feel like we
    should find a way to easily serialize those conversations into a format
    that can be left on the web instead. that others (or we) can revisit in
    the future. maybe a lightly edited / auto-transcribed audio recording?).
  </p>

  <p>we received some critical feedback about the our zine today that left me
    feeling pretty deflated. w/o much motivation to continue working on the
    zine or any of the games in it. the feedback was principally about layout
    decisions we&#39;d made in response to <em>other</em> feedback we&#39;ve received.
    i think i usually do a pretty good job of leaving feedback on the floor
    that i don&#39;t feel like serves my own creative goals, but i think i kinda
    failed this time.
  </p>

  <p>as a result, i&#39;d spent a lot of effort this past weekend to try and pull
    some of the threads together on the presentation-side of the zine, and it
    felt like work. and it <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> feel like work. it should feel
    fun. that should&#39;ve been the first sniff that something was off (three
    &quot;should&quot;s in a row, no good). one nice thing about this particular piece
    of feedback is that it&#39;s made me realize i was doing this work for purely
    external validation. it wasn&#39;t for me, and that&#39;s not sustainable. what&#39;s
    the point of that? (a lot of &quot;me&quot;s too, but i don&#39;t want to speak for
    anyone else).
