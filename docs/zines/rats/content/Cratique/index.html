<article class="Cratique svelte-vh6et7"><h3><b>why i dislike rats as a theme for making games</b></h3>
    while they are interesting characters, and their cuteness or grossness is very appealing, rats have too much personality. its very
    easy to make a game that has a rat in it, but it is hard to make it be about the rats as an object. its hard to interact with the
    rat as a rat, not with the rat as a character. (the continuous use of cheese shows this a lot, we are making games with the caricature
    of rats). additionally the games are not about the ratness of the rat, or in any way attempting to simulate/immerse/contemplate
    the behaviours of rats. (sadly rats in bags didn&#39;t happen, but still, that is rats in bags as an object not the rats themselves).
    using some design-speak, it is very hard to come up with the affordances of the rat (in this sense, its hard to objectify a rat).
    one of my main interests in a theme like this, is its dissection (you can only dissect a dead rat, (or kill it in the process)).
    i want a theme that is more dissectable, that we can explore many uses of our object, that we can make people think of the object
    in ways they haven&#39;t before. to make videogames like still lives of objects. animals are not good objects, they are good characters.
