          <div class="Game-body">this is one that you might be able to play at a cafeteria, also a reason to not throw away plastic forks. it is
            currently a game for 2, but maybe it can be played with many. place a quarter in a plastic fork, ideally by
            alternating the tines (I had to look up
            <a class="Link svelte-193kav2" href="https://www.homenish.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Parts-of-a-Fork.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this fork diagram
  </a>),
            just like the picture below. your objective is now to drop your opponents quarter without dropping your own. its a
            very sensitive game. our swordfigher friend consistently won, so even if it may seem random, theres a lot of skill
            involved. make sure to have some fun start of the match ritual, and a very flamboyant fencing pose. en garde!

          <div class="Game-body">an imagination game for any number of people (even one). you all close your eyes, lie down if you’re so inclined, and
            imagine you’re in a darkroom developing a photo. it’s sitting in a tray of developer, currently blank. the goal is not
            to invent anything, but to describe whatever you actually see in your imagination. when you notice something, say it
            out loud. at a certain point you’ll all know the photo is done, and you can take it out of the tray and develop the
            next one.

            it&#39;s nice if you put something fun on the screen. slowly lower the projector towards the ground while the two people
            in the box try and squeeze each other out of the space as it gets smaller.

            a row, and if two people say a number at the same time, you start over. when you get to 5, shout your word, throw your
            hands in the air, and head home. you could play to a different number if you&#39;re feeling up for it.

          <div class="Game-body">this game is to be played with a balloon on a windy day. the point is to try getting the balloon as far as possible
            against the wind. you know the feeling of bouncing a balloon on a windy day, and the lack of control, but pure fun, it
            causes. this game takes that and makes a cooperative version of not letting the balloon touch the floor. in a very
            classic move chosing the most intense adversary, the wind, and the most arbitrary constraint, going against the wind
            and each player not allowed to hit the ball twice in a row. the grasshopper would approve. we even have a

  <div class="Game-body"><p>we all know playing with candles is fun. this one is simple, for as many players as you can (we played with 2 and 3).
            lit up your candles, and don&#39;t let people turn yours off. protect yours and blow theirs, just dont move too fast
            creating wind for yourself.
          </p>
          <p>a nice thing about this one is that you will also be litting each others candles to restart the game, creating a back
            and forth of collaboration and competition. also, it just looks nice.
