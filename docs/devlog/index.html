            this is one that you might be able to play at a cafeteria, also a reason to not throw away plastic forks. it
            is currently a game for 2, but maybe it can be played with many. place a quarter in a plastic fork, ideally
            by alternating the tines (I had to look up
            <a href="https://www.homenish.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Parts-of-a-Fork.jpg" target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer">this fork diagram</a>),
            just like the picture below. your objective is now to drop your opponents quarter without dropping your own.
            its a very sensitive game. our swordfigher friend consistently won, so even if it may seem random, theres a
            lot of skill involved. make sure to have some fun start of the match ritual, and a very flamboyant fencing
            pose.
            en garde!

            an imagination game for any number of people (even one). you all close your eyes, lie down if
            you’re so inclined, and imagine you’re in a darkroom developing a photo. it’s sitting in a tray of
            developer, currently blank. the goal is not to invent anything, but to describe whatever you actually see in
            your imagination. when you notice something, say it out loud. at a certain point you’ll all know the photo
            is done, and you can take it out of the tray and develop the next one.

            one person holds a projector towards the ground, pretty high up so to people can fit in the box of light it
            creates. it's nice if you put something fun on the screen. slowly lower the projector towards the ground
            while the two people in the box try and squeeze each other out of the space as it gets smaller.

            this is one to play before you all head home. everyone puts their hands in the middle and pick a word to say
            together on the count of 5. like, "turtle on 5!". then try to count to 5, but each person is only allowed to
            say one number in a row, and if two people say a number at the same time, you start over. when you get to 5,
            shout your word, throw your hands in the air, and head home. you could play to a different number if you're
            feeling up for it.

            this game is to be played with a balloon on a windy day. the point is to try getting the balloon as far as
            possible against the wind. you know the feeling of bouncing a balloon on a windy day, and the lack of
            control, but pure fun, it causes. this game takes that and makes a cooperative version of not letting the
            balloon touch the floor. in a very classic move chosing the most intense adversary, the wind, and the most
            arbitrary constraint, going against the wind and each player not allowed to hit the ball twice in a row. the
            grasshopper would approve.
