      <p>
        here is the introductory text for the rats zine. this is a zine about rats,
        and in it you should expect to encounter rats and things about rats. we chose
        the theme of rats somewhat arbitrarily, because we love rats, and because we
        wanted to work on making a bunch of small games together that would allow us
        to explore our diverging interests towards some common goal.
