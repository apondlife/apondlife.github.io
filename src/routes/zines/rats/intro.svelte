    here is the introductory text for the rats zine. this is a zine about rats,
    and in it you should expect to encounter rats and things about rats. we chose
    the theme of rats somewhat arbitrarily, because we love rats, and because we
    wanted to work on making a bunch of small games together that would allow us
    to explore our diverging interests towards some common goal.
