    here is the some more text about rats. one common objects that was in our shared ideas was a trash bag full of rats inside. Do
    rats procreate inside of them? Is it possible for a trash bag to migrate because of the rats inside of it. If so, does the
    collective consciousness of the rats inside the bag have a consciousness of its own. A world full of bags, with a world full
    of rats and trash inside. many thoughts about that, but implementing a physically realistic bag of rats was outside the scope
    of this project. (if you think the world is really in need of a fully fledged videogame about rats inside a bag, please
    contact us at <Link href="mailto:frogfrogforg@gmail.com" />).
