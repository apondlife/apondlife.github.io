    <h1>
      in the trash
    </h1>

    <p class="RatsInBag-one">
      one common objects that was in our shared ideas was a trash bag full of rats inside. Do
      rats procreate inside of them? Is it possible for a trash bag to migrate because of the rats inside of it. If so, does the
      collective consciousness of the rats inside the bag have a consciousness of its own.
    </p>

    <p class="RatsInBag-two">
      what is the rat searching for in the bag? how does it know when it has found it? when it has found
      enough? do rats enter or leave the bag as friends or enemies? what does it feel like
      to squeeze through the gaps in the trash, grime, dark? to grasp with claw, tooth, tail? to emerge, finally,
      into the streetlight? with object of desire? without?
    </p>

    <p class="RatsInBag-one">
      A world full of bags, with a world full
      of rats and trash inside. many thoughts about that, but implementing a physically realistic bag of rats was outside the scope
      of this project. (if you think the world is really in need of a fully fledged videogame about rats inside a bag, please
      <Link href="mailto:frogfrogforg@gmail.com" text="e-mail us" />).
    </p>

    <p class="RatsInBag-two">
      please send us an e-mail. we should make this game. an animate bag of street trash. life diving from (and through)
      bag of trash to bag of trash. side-by-side w/ the juice, the tissue, the bread crust. the only mobile one amongst
      yr peers. and how mobile you are.
