    Why I dislike rats as a theme for making games. While they are interesting characters, and their cuteness or grossness is very
    appealing, rats have too much personality. Its very easy to make a game that has a rat in it, but it is hard to make it be
    about the rats as an object. Its hard to interact with the rat as a rat, not with the rat as a character. (the continuous use
    of cheese shows this a lot, we are making games with the caricature of rats). And also the games are not about the ratness of
    the rat, or in any way attempting to simulate/immerse/contemplate the behaviours of rats. (sadly rats in bags didn't happen,
    but still, that is rats in bags as an object not the rats themselves). usind some design-speak, it is very hard to come up
    with the affordances of the rat (in this sense, its hard to objectify a rat). one of my main interests in a theme like this,
    is its dissection (you can only dissect a dead rat, (or kill it in the process)). i want a theme that is more dissectable,
    that we can explore many uses of our object, that we can make people think of the object in ways they haven't before. to make
    videogames like still lives of objects. animals are not good objects, they are good characters.
