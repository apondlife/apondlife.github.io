  <p>to make good use of the shortness and responsiveness of these, i'll write my thoughts on this to warm up. also what I would personally like to do. </p>

  <p>first thought, i dont understand what chew means haha (this was not the first thought, but I realised it should be)</p>

  <p>second thought, is that unless the container is as broad as "a webpage", it seems to me that the container is as restrictive as a theme, but in a different direction. for example, if the container is a 3d unity game, it seems harder to incorporate a larp about rats in it. maybe i am mixing the idea of a container with that of a process.

    my personal interest with the theme was to explore the playable affordances of a certain thing. what kind of game related stuff would be possible to make that relate to that thing. it mostly came from thinking about candles. i think i was interested in exploring toy making with an object constraint, and didn't feel that rats filled that purpose. i also think that that is not the desire of the rest of the group with choosing a theme. if not for this, i really have no particular desire for having a theme, and thing it might be more limiting than generative to have one. the only other useful aspect of a theme is to guide in absolute lack of direction (which in the end i feel is what unified all of us to accept choosing a theme to just start doing stuff)
   </p>

     maybe a container is just a different type of theme. thinking container first, content second? idk anymore, i feel a bit frustrated on the concept of making many games and putting them together in a space. it seems to me like reinventing dumpling.love, when it simply exist there, even if in a weird spot right now (maybe because of the weird spot it is right now this desire to reinvent it exists). my main interest in many games existing together in a single place is how they interact with each other.
