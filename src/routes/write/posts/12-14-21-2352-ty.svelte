    wanna keep these posts short and respondable, so i'm going to try and break
    them up thematically. this one is about what i would personally like to do, at
    least as far as i can see right now thisveryminute.
  </p>

  <p>
    i want to make something chewier than what we have on this first prototype. something that's
    like 30% stuff the weight of what we have in <Link href="/zines/rats" text="rats"/>, 40% stuff
    thats a bit chewier, and 30% something quite chewy. where that cheweist 30% is something we
    could reuse issue-to-issue.

    re. theme, it doesn't seem to me like picking a single theme is a good solution. i am happy to
    create within the constraints of a theme, but it might be better to work in a container that is
    permissive of more themes. so that people who are excited about a theme can explore it until they're
    tired of it. so that we can each fall off at different rates and move on to what we care about, but
    still contribute to some greater whole. something unified not by theme, but by its aesthetic container:
    audio/visual/literary/ludic(yuck/sorry/such/a/gross/word)/&c gum that binds everything together. i
    don't think that means the container needs to be homogenous. it just means that there needs to be some
    aesthetic thread linking two of its constituent parts together, even if the thread between another
    two is totally different.
  </p>

    the container that's exciting me most atm is something like mystical ninja starring goemon. a weird
    and irrevent three dimensional world to walk around in. where characters say things to you: maybe
    tell a joke, announce the full text essay, present you with a tiny playable. where you can walk around
    and struggle to not trip over divergent little experiments, minigames, games, &c. maybe less of a
    zine or issue and more of a demodisc. or less of a demodisc and more a playable prototype(s) that the
    developers sent to a prospective publisher to try and entice them into business. a bunch of stuff
    people poured their hearts into but wisely left behind before their hearts went out of it.

    and i'd like to figure out how to make money. to sustain. to get real. a bit ago i tweeted that
    i don't individual passion is durable. that anything sustainable needs to be the socialize passion,
    interest. a thing will fail, fall apart, be unsustainable otherwise. i still believe it.
