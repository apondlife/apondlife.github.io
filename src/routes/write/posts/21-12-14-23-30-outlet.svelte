    had a mess of thoughts & feelings swirling around in my head this evening,
    the sort of stuff i'd usually exorcise in a retro. everyone else is busy
    or unavailable tho, so i beat metroid dread (ugh) & got an ice cream & got
    six-pack of beer & decided to write (that these kind of thoughts often get
    left effectively undocumented on the retro board makes me feel like we
    should find a way to easily serialize those conversations into a format
    that can be left on the web instead. that others (or we) can revisit in
    the future. maybe a lightly edited / auto-transcribed audio recording?).

    we received some critical feedback about the our zine today that left me
    feeling pretty deflated. w/o much motivation to continue working on the
    zine or any of the games in it. the feedback was principally about layout
    decisions we'd made in response to <em>other</em> feedback we've received.
    i think i usually do a pretty good job of leaving feedback on the floor
    that i don't feel like serves my own creative goals, but i think i kinda
    failed this time.

    as a result, i'd spent a lot of effort this past weekend to try and pull
    some of the threads together on the presentation-side of the zine, and it
    felt like work. and it <em>shouldn't</em> feel like work. it should feel
    fun. that should've been the first sniff that something was off (three
    "should"s in a row, no good). one nice thing about this particular piece
    of feedback is that it's made me realize i was doing this work for purely
    external validation. it wasn't for me, and that's not sustainable. what's
    the point of that? (a lot of "me"s too, but i don't want to speak for
    anyone else).
