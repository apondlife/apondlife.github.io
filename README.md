easiest way to run the website is to open the `src/index.html` file in your browser.

if you have `python3` intalled, you could run:

```sh
$ python3 -m http.server --directory docs
```

and if you're on a mac you could run:

```sh
$ ./start
```

and then you can access the site at `http://localhost:8000`.
